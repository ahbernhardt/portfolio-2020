      Iâ€™m currently completing my Master Degree in Software Engineering at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.stthomas.edu/" target="_blank">University of St. Thomas</a>
      building things for the web and applications.
      I graduated from <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.bemidjistate.edu/" target="_blank">Bemidji
      State University</a> with B.S in Design.

      As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. I focus primarily on building, prototyping and implementing user interfaces that are usable and scalable for any web-based platform.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably camping, researching new local
      restaurants, building LEGO, or crossing off another item on my bucket list and share photos on <a
